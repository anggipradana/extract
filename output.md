A skilled ethical hacker was assigned to perform a thorough OS discovery on a potential target. They decided to adopt an advanced fingerprinting technique and sent a TCP packet to an open TCP port with specific flags enabled. Upon receiving the reply, they noticed the flags were SYN and ECN-Echo. Which test did the ethical hacker conduct and why was this specific approach adopted? 
Suggested Answer: C üó≥Ô∏è 

A. Test 3: The test was executed to observe the response of the target system when a packet with URC, PSH, SYN, and FIN flags was sent, thereby identifying the OS

B. Test 2: This test was chosen because a TCP packet with no flags enabled is known as a NULL packet and this would allow the hacker to assess the OS of the target

C. Test 1: The test was conducted because SYN and ECN-Echo flags enabled to allow the hacker to probe the nature of the response and subsequently determine the OS fingerprint

D. Test 6: The hacker selected this test because a TCP packet with the ACK flag enabled sent to a closed TCP port would yield more information about the OS

In an intricate web application architecture using an Oracle database, you, as a security analyst, have identified a potential SQL Injection attack surface. The database consists of 'x' tables, each with 'y' columns. Each table contains 'z' records. An attacker, well-versed in SQLi techniques, crafts 'u' SQL payloads, each attempting to extract maximum data from the database. The payloads include 'UNION SELECT' statements and 'DBMS_XSLPROCESSOR.READ2CLOB' to read sensitive files. The attacker aims to maximize the total data extracted 'E=xyz*u'. Assuming 'x=4', 'y=2', and varying 'z' and 'u', which situation is likely to result in the highest extracted data volume? 
Suggested Answer: D üó≥Ô∏è 

A. z=600, u=2: The attacker devises 2 SQL payloads, each aimed at tables holding 600 records, affecting all columns across all tables.

B. z=550, u=2: Here, the attacker formulates 2 SQL payloads and directs them towards tables containing 550 records, impacting all columns and tables.

C. z=500, u=3: The attacker creates 3 SQL payloads and targets tables with 500 records each, exploiting all columns and tables.

D. z=400, u=4: The attacker constructs 4 SQL payloads, each focusing on tables with 400 records, influencing all columns of all tables.

As a cybersecurity professional, you are responsible for securing a high-traffic web application that uses MySQL as its backend database. Recently, there has been a surge of unauthorized login attempts, and you suspect that a seasoned black-hat hacker is behind them. This hacker has shown proficiency in SQL Injection and appears to be using the 'UNION' SQL keyword to trick the login process into returning additional data. However, your application‚Äôs security measures include filtering special characters in user inputs, a method usually effective against such attacks. In this challenging environment, if the hacker still intends to exploit this SQL Injection vulnerability, which strategy is he most likely to employ? 
Suggested Answer: C üó≥Ô∏è 

A. The hacker tries to manipulate the 'UNION' keyword in such a way that it triggers a database error, potentially revealing valuable information about the database's structure.

B. The hacker switches tactics and resorts to a 'time-based blind' SQL Injection attack, which would force the application to delay its response, thereby revealing information based on the duration of the delay.

C. The hacker attempts to bypass the special character filter by encoding his malicious input, which could potentially enable him to successfully inject damaging SQL queries.

D. The hacker alters his approach and injects a DROP TABLE' statement, a move that could potentially lead to the loss of vital data stored in the application's database.

[All 312-50v13 Questions]

An audacious attacker is targeting a web server you oversee. He intends to perform a Slow HTTP POST attack, by manipulating 'a' HTTP connection. Each connection sends a byte of data every 'b' second, effectively holding up the connections for an extended period. Your server is designed to manage 'm' connections per second, but any connections exceeding this number tend to overwhelm the system. Given 'a=100' and variable 'm', along with the attacker's intention of maximizing the attack duration 'D=a*b', consider the following scenarios. Which is most likely to result in the longest duration of server unavailability? 
Suggested Answer: A üó≥Ô∏è 

A. m=90, b=15: The server can manage 90 connections per second, but the attacker's 100 connections exceed this, and with each connection held up for 15 seconds, the attack duration could be significant.

B. m=105, b=12: The server can manage 105 connections per second, more than the attacker's 100 connections, likely maintaining operation despite a moderate hold-up time.

C. m=110, b=20: Despite the attacker sending 100 connections, the server can handle 110 connections per second, therefore likely staying operative, regardless of the hold-up time per connection.

D. m=95, b=10: Here, the server can handle 95 connections per second, but it falls short against the attacker's 100 connections, albeit the hold-up time per connection is lower.

Question #: 162
Topic #: 1

[All 312-50v13 Questions]

Consider a hypothetical situation where an attacker, known for his proficiency in SQL Injection attacks, is targeting your web server. This adversary meticulously crafts 'q' malicious SQL queries, each inducing a delay of 'd' seconds in the server response. This delay in response is an indicator of a potential attack. If the total delay, represented by the product 'q*d', crosses a defined threshold 'T', an alert is activated in your security system. Furthermore, it is observed that the attacker prefers prime numbers for 'q', and 'd' follows a pattern in the Fibonacci sequence. Now, consider 'd=13' seconds (a Fibonacci number) and various values of 'q' (a prime number) and 'T'. Which among the following scenarios will most likely trigger an alert? 
Suggested Answer: A üó≥Ô∏è 

A. q=17, T=220: Even though the attacker increases 'q', the total delay ('q*d' = 221 seconds) just surpasses the threshold, possibly activating an alert.

B. q=13, T=180: In this case, the total delay caused by the attacker ('q*d' = 169 seconds) breaches the threshold, likely leading to the triggering of a security alert.

C. q=11, T=150: Here, the total delay induced by the attacker ('q*d' = 143 seconds) does not surpass the threshold, so the security system remains dormant.

D. q=19, T=260: Despite the attacker's increased effort, the total delay ('q*d' = 247 seconds) does not exceed the threshold, thus no alert is triggered.

**Answer: A**

[All 312-50v13 Questions]

You are the lead cybersecurity analyst at a multinational corporation that uses a hybrid encryption system to secure inter-departmental communications. The system uses RSA encryption for key exchange and AES for data encryption, taking advantage of the strengths of both asymmetric and symmetric encryption. Each RSA key pair has a size of 'n' bits, with larger keys providing more security at the cost of slower performance. The time complexity of generating an RSA key pair is O(n^2), and AES encryption has a time complexity of O(n). An attacker has developed a quantum algorithm with time complexity O((log n)^2) to crack RSA encryption. Given 'n=4000' and variable 'AES key size', which scenario is likely to provide the best balance of security and performance? 
Suggested Answer: C üó≥Ô∏è 

A. AES key size=128 bits: This configuration provides less security than option A, but RSA key generation and AES encryption will be faster.

B. AES key size=256 bits: This configuration provides a high level of security, but RSA key generation may be slow.

C. AES key size=192 bits: This configuration is a balance between options A and B, providing moderate security and performance.

D. AES key size=512 bits: This configuration provides the highest level of security but at a significant performance cost due to the large AES key size.

A multinational corporation's computer system was infiltrated by an advanced persistent threat (APT). During forensic analysis, it was discovered that the malware was utilizing a blend of two highly sophisticated techniques to stay undetected and continue its operations.Firstly, the malware was embedding its harmful code into the actual binary or executable part of genuine system files rather than appending or prepending itself to the files. This made it exceptionally difficult to detect and eradicate, as doing so risked damaging the system files themselves.Secondly, the malware exhibited characteristics of a type of malware that changes its code as it propagates, making signature-based detection approaches nearly impossible.On top of these, the malware maintained a persistent presence by installing itself in the registry, making it able to survive system reboots.Given these distinctive characteristics, which two types of malware techniques does this malware most closely embody?

[All 312-50v13 Questions]

A sophisticated attacker targets your web server with the intent to execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. His strategy involves a unique mixture of TCP SYN, UDP, and ICMP floods, using 'r' packets per second. Your server, reinforced with advanced security measures, can handle 'h' packets per second before it starts showing signs of strain. If 'r' surpasses 'h', it overwhelms the server, causing it to become unresponsive. In a peculiar pattern, the attacker selects 'r' as a composite number and 'h' as a prime number, making the attack detection more challenging. Considering 'r=2010' and different values for 'h', which of the following scenarios would potentially cause the server to falter? 
Suggested Answer: A üó≥Ô∏è 

A. h=1987 (prime): The attacker's packet rate exceeds the server's capacity, causing potential unresponsiveness.

B. h=1999 (prime): Despite the attacker's packet flood, the server can handle these requests, remaining responsive.

C. h=1993 (prime): Despite being less than 'r', the server's prime number capacity keeps it barely operational, but the risk of falling is imminent.

D. h=2003 (prime): The server can manage more packets than the attacker is sending, hence it stays operational.

Your network infrastructure is under a SYN flood attack. The attacker has crafted an automated botnet to simultaneously send 's' SYN packets per second to the server. You have put measures in place to manage 'f' SYN packets per second, and the system is designed to deal with this number without any performance issues. If 's' exceeds 'f', the network infrastructure begins to show signs of overload. The system's response time increases exponentially (2^k), where 'k' represents each additional SYN packet above the 'f' limit. Now, considering 's=500' and different 'f' values, in which scenario is the server most likely to experience overload and significantly increased response times? 
Suggested Answer: D üó≥Ô∏è 

A. f=510: The server can handle 510 SYN packets per second, which is greater than what the attacker is sending. The system stays stable, and the response time remains unaffected.

B. f=495: The server can handle 495 SYN packets per second. The response time drastically rises (2^5 = 32 times the normal), indicating a probable system overload.

C. f=505: The server can handle 505 SYN packets per second. In this case, the response time increases but not as drastically (2^5 = 32 times the normal), and the system might still function, albeit slowly.

D. f=490: The server can handle 490 SYN packets per second. With 's' exceeding 'f' by 10, the response time shoots up (2^10 = 1024 times the usual response time), indicating a system overload.
